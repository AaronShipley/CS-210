This is a code is used as a banking calculator to help people understand initial investments and how certain interest rates accrue over set years to show what the total investment can become. 
One area I did well on was keeping with professional standards with inline comments. It is well spaced and clean, to create a very readable code.
I could have enhanced my code better by making a display that would have been more eye catching, yet more uderstandable. The menu seemed a little jumbled when I wrote it out. It should have had more explanation behind it and spacing of lines to clean it up.
I found writing the parameters in the functions for interest rate and calling upon this code in the main cpp to be somewhat tough to understand and write in correct form. This topic is fairly new to me and took wuite a while.
Skills I learned within this project that are transferrable to other projects are invaluable. The ability to use other files in the program like main.cpp and banking.h were a chore to understand and apply. This problem solving skill is great for future projects.
Making this project readable, I maintained proper syntax and in line comments. To maintain this code and make it adaptable, The parameters and loops created were not set to literals in order to keep it open for multiple inouts. This also makes it adaptable for other projects that may need similar code, but adapt it to their needs.
