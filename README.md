This is a code is used as a banking calculator to help people understand initial investments and how certain interest rates accrue over set years to show what the total investment can become. 
One area I did well on was keeping with professional standards with inline comments. It is well spaced and clean, to create a very readable code.
The code could have been more efficient if I would have utilized another language like Python in order to call upon functions in c++ to better clean up the code and be able to debug easier to parse out my code.
One area that I found challenging was writing the parameters in the code to initalize the clock. These parameters were tough for me to understand and learn how to do correctly.
The ability to properly utilize different functions at the same time, as to not just focus on one part of my code and a particular output. Being able to multi-task and keep my mind not just singularly focused is a definite skill that is transfrerrable to other projects.
by not setting specific parameters to a string literal or integer leaves the code open and adaptable for other uses. It is made readable by following industry best practices. The display menu is easy to understand and very interactive.
